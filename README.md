Json lib in cpp, made for personal use in my other projects.
Not fully compliant to RFC 8259.
Nested array not supported for example.

Need to check performance and to do some unit testing.
Maybe add a namespace. Need better handling of the destructors and of memory management.

Apart from that, works fine.
